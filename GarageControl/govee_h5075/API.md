## decode temperature and humitity

Example:
1. Three octets are: 03 71 e7
2. Convert to decimal: 0x0371e7, v = 225767
3. Get rel. humidity in %: h = v % 1000 / 10, h = 76.7%
4. get temperature in °C (positiv value): t = int(v / 1000) / 10, v = 22.5°C
5. get temperature in °C (negative value): see example code

Example code:
```python
    def decodeMeasurement(bytes) -> 'tuple[float,float]':

        # Note that integer requires 4 bytes (fill with 00), e.g. 0x0371e7 --> 0x000371e7
        raw = struct.unpack(">I", bytes)[0]
        if raw & 0x800000:
            is_negative = True
            raw = raw ^ 0x800000
        else:
            is_negative = False

        temperatureC = int(raw / 1000) / 10
        if is_negative:
            temperatureC = 0 - temperatureC

        relHumidity = (raw % 1000) / 10

        return temperatureC, relHumidity
